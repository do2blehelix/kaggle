# Titanic Survival :: Kaggle Data Exploration and Competetion
> The **Pytanic** file contains the Exploration of the Training data and submission of the Testing data in **Jupyter Notebook**
> The **TitRanic** file contains the same in **R**

The Basic Stages are as follows which are shown in the Pytanic file:
* Understand the objective
* Understand the data
* Data Preparation
* Model Building
  * Instantiate
  * Fit
  * Predict
  * Score
* Model Evaluation


### Note: This is a work in progress and I continue to strive to achieve better results. So some columns built in the data preparation might be excluded from the model.
